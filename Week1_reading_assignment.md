1.Summary of Article: The article focuses on the subnational growth and their proximate geographic areas. 
The researchers use data from around 3,000 first-level, subnational areas across 169 countries, as a result they find that spatial
autocorrelation is a critical factor in explaining growth at the subnational level. Based off the data they can see
that certain areas affect growth independent of national economic policy, examples are: soil suitability for agriculture and malaria ecologies. 
Lastly their spatial analysis demonstrates how conflict consistently leads to a negative effect on subnational growth.

2.Reflection: The reason why I like this data is because it is looking at a lot of different countries and to an extend their correlation with one another. 
Understanding how different types of growth can have large impacts is very interesting to see from a more data driven way and can really support conclusions
about the interconnectness of policy, markets, and the environment, can all heavily impact poverty rates. I feel that often times researchers may
have made theories about the impacts but using spatial data can confirm whether speculations are true or are they biased in beliefs of how the researcher sees the world.
It also speaks to me because I feel that sometimes linear graphs or even equations do not explain the depth of the story of numbers, but data used in a spatial manner
can have more profound impact because of its ability to translate information into a more visually understandable way.
