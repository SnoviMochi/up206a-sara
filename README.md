My name is **Sara Omanovic** *(I started this a little later since I just was added into the class at the end of week 2)*
I am a second year Master Public Policy student who is focused on the topics of poverty & inequality. However I have a lot of interest in migration, public health and food rights. I have started working for the County of Los Angeles and as a result my interest in being able to truly understand GIS, mapping and how to read maps has increased. Having a better understanding of what data can do and how best to use it to represent things can be a very powerful tool and so that is why I really wanted to take this class!
GIS : **Geographic Information Systems** - this course helps students with the beginning steps of mapping data, using shape files and creating shape files.
I am working on a capstone project in regards to youth diversion programs, I would like to work on how to map out resources and points where youth encounter law enforcement in the LA County basin. But I am also very much inspired by looking through census data and seeing poverty/racial disparaties and making a compelling arguement about socio-economic zones throughout the state of California to push forward policy.
