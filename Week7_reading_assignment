##Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl##
##Christopher Barrington-Leigha,b,1,2 and Adam Millard-Ballc,1##
#The analysis by the two authors is an interesting one that it demonstrates the global trends in which increased sprawl / decreased interconnectedness is a trend of 
#higher income countries (there are a few outliers though in this anaylsis such as Japan). However the authors note that the reason for sprawl is determined by a few factors.
#One reason for sprawl is the development of automobile oriented development patterns. Another is booms in development such as housing, suburban development. Poor public
#transportation also contributes. Lastly a combination of wak planning institutions and high rates of crime can lead to developer-led, middle-class housing on the urban fringe.
#They break down their analysis further by describing how recent trends inform us that sprawl is increasing, and that global decline in street connectivity has been 
# ongoing trend since 1975. That there is different classification for stree-network types that help us understand the rise in gated communities,and as a result irregularities in the grid.
# And lastly how local & country level connectivity tends to reproduce itself over time, which impacts path dependence.
#It's an interesting article to see how different regions development and how trends with low to high earning countries can take on different sprawl patterns based on
#persistence, foresight, rapid expansion and living patterns.
