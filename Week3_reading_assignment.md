Watching Geoff Boeing + Reading the OSMNx impact:


What I appreciated by learning from Professor Boeing is that fact that the idea of endless research questions have motivated him in developing a tool that can be used by so many.
The field of planning has changed quite a lot because of his work and development of the street networks. I believe the question of accessibility to more people is somethign that points out
the flaw of this work is that it is difficult for policy to be made because policy makers do not often times know how to read or create data. The idea of understanding the impacts
of natural disasters by taking out certain blocks and seeing the efficiency of networks can dramatically change disaster relief and response. Seeing where resources are allocated and how
neighborhoods have been changing can inform policy of what past mistakes were made such as neighborhood development, downtown expansions and freeway development. To have access
to this information is very powerful for the development of preventative policy. I would be curious about going more indepth with these street networks and starting to map out
the development of countries, how countries change after war, where relief should be sent to isolated communities and how cities should rebuild after natural disasters.
